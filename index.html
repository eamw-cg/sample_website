    <h1>My Learn Enough Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. <br> <br>
      This includes everything from command lines and coding, to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br> <br>
      The team at Learn Enough believes there are at least a billion people who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.<br> <br>
