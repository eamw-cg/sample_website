    <h1>My Learn Enough™ Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      <em>Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous</em> is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding, to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br> 
      <br>
      The team at <em>Learn Enough™</em> believes that there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, and probably more.<br> 
      <br>
      I am one of those billion people, and I have <em>absolutely benefited</em> from completing several <em>Learn Enough™</em> tutorials already, with more to come! <br>

    <h2><em>Learn Enough™</em> Background</h2>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to be Dangerous is an outgrowth of <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. <br>
        <br>
        <em>This</em> page is being created as an exercise for the <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough™ HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a> tutorial, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. <br>
        <br>
        This site is a near duplicate of the sample site created to support that tutorial, which I have only changed to include information about <em>my</em> experience and goals for taking these tutorials in the first place.

        <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.
