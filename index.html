    <h1>My Learn Enough™ Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      <em>Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous</em> is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding, to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br> 
      <br>
      The team at <em>Learn Enough™</em> believes that there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, and probably more.<br> 
      <br>
      I am one of those billion people, and I have <em>absolutely benefited</em> from completing several <em>Learn Enough™</em> tutorials already, with more to come! <br>

    <h2><em>Learn Enough™</em> Background</h2>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>. <br>
        <br>
        <em>This</em> page is being created as an exercise for the <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a> tutorial, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="http://learnenough.com">learnenough.com</a><br>
        <br>
        This site is a near duplicate of the sample site created to support that tutorial, which I have only changed to include information about <em>my</em> experience in taking these tutorials, as well as my goals for learning these skills.

    <h2><em>Learn Enough™</em> Founders</h2>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. They believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the Learn Enough™ tutorials can benefit
        <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
      
      <p>  
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee Donahoe in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough™ tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

      <p>
        You may have seen Nick Merwin shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or the Ellen show, but rest assured he is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
