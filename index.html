    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Using <em>Learn Enough</em> to Gain New Skills</h1>
    
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        <em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous™</em> is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding, to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. 
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        The team at <em>Learn Enough</em> believes that there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, and probably more. 
      </p>
      
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        I am one of those billion people, and I have <em>absolutely benefited</em> from completing several <em>Learn Enough</em> tutorials already, with more to come!

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.widipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">Background</h2>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        Learn Enough to be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        <em>This</em> page is being created as an exercise for the <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a> tutorial, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at <a href="http://learnenough.com">learnenough.com</a>

        This site is a near duplicate of the sample site created to support that tutorial, which I have only changed to include information about <em>my</em> experience in taking these tutorials, as well as my goals for learning these skills.

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">Founders</h2>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        <em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous™</em> was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
        Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. They believe that the kind of technical
        sophistication taught by the <em>Learn Enough</em> tutorials can benefit
        <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

        <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242511619?s=150" alt="author gravatar"  style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        I started the <em>Learn Enough</em> tutorials at the recommendation of a friend. I work in a technological field, but I have never had to do coding or programming as part of my regular work. But, with the increasing availability of AI-driven tools, I realized it was time for me to upskill - at least enough so that I could use and (even more important!) evaluate outputs from AI tools
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        Additionally, I have several hobbies, and I have occasionally thought to myself "wouldn't it be awesome if I could make <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, or <em>Z</em>" kind of tool, app, or whatever to help me do some parts of those hobbies more efficiently?" And lo and behold!, the <em>Learn Enough</em> tutorials offer me the foundational skills and knowledge that I need to start exploring some of these projects!
      </p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 40px;">Why Learn Enough and not Some Other Option?</h2>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
        Before starting with <em>Learn Enough</em>, I did explore some other tutorial options. There are a seemingly infinite number of tutorials and tools available online to learn these skills, and many of them are completely free! But inevitably a pattern started repeating:
        
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
            -I'd start a course or tutorial<br>
            -Everything would go great! ... for a while<br>
            -Suddenly the tutorial is assuming that I have all kinds of background knowledge that I just don't have<br>
            -Or! The tutorial is uber technical, focusing on miniscule details and academic arcana<br>
            -And I start to feel like I'm learning lots of academic knowledge, but I'm not sure how useful this information will be day-to-day
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
            And then my friend recommended that I check out <a href="http://learnenough.com">learnenough.com</a>. 
        
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
          What makes <em>Learn Enough</em> different is that they start off by assuming that <strong>you know nothing</strong>. Beginning with <em>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</em>, they introduce you to absolutely basic computer knowledge. They help guide you through downloading the right programs. And they leave enough ambiguity to allow you to build your <em>technical sopistication</em> by seeking out your own answers to some questions and challenges. 
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
            Not only am I much closer to making the personal projects that I want to make. Not only am I increasing my knowledge for more effectiveness in my job. <strong>BUT ALSO</strong> I've learned more about how my own computer works and how to take advantage of it, I'm thinking and problem solving in new ways, and I'm having <em>so much fun</em> while I'm learning!
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;" style="margin-right: 40px; text-align: right;">
            And here you are, reading my words on a website that I made, soup to nuts, myself! I'm using the command line, tracking crap on GitHub, and building a (very) simple website! I can't wait to see what I build next.
