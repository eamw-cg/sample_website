    <h1>My Learn Enough™ Story</h1>
    
    <p>
      <em>Learn Enough™ to Be Dangerous</em> is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding, to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br> 
      <br>
      The team at <em>Learn Enough™</em> believes that there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, and probably more.<br> 
      <br>
      I am one of those billion people, and I have <em>absolutely benefited</em> from completing several <em>Learn Enough™</em> tutorials already, with more to come! <br>
